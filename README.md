# Three.js Basic Example

This project demonstrates a basic setup for a Three.js application.

## Project Structure

```
basic/
  index.html
  main.js
  style.css
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the Three.js app.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript entry point (currently empty, ready for your Three.js code).
- `style.css`: Basic CSS reset for the app.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.
2. Add your Three.js code to `main.js`.

## Requirements

- No build tools required. Just open the HTML file in a browser that supports ES modules.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (add via CDN or npm if needed).

## License

This project is for learning and demonstration purposes.
